# URL-Shortner
 I created a Django-based URL shortener that converted lengthy links into concise ones, making sharing easier. Users tracked click analytics, managed links through personalized dashboards, and admins oversaw analytics and user management. This project showcased my proficiency in Django and practical web development skills.
